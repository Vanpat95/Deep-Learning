Used Pandas and scikit-learnâ€™s StandardScaler() to preprocess the dataset.

Scaled the training and testing features datasets by creating a StandardScaler instance, fitting it to the training data, then using the transform function.

The model was optimized using TensorFlow to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

The results were exported to an HDF5 file.
